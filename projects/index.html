        During my undergraduate study, I have participated in several projects in <a href="#robotics"><b>robotics</b>, <b>controls</b></a>, <a href="#vision"><b>computer vision, graphics</b></a>, and <a href="#modelling"><b>modelling</b></a>. I am really looking forward to conduct any relative research in my graduate study. These past endeavors helps me build up my abilities to explore the core principles of topics and solve practical problems independently. Besides, I also found that I enjoyed working on a multi-disciplinary team because our diverse fields helped us accomplish our goals effectively and efficiently.
